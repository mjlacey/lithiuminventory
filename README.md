# Lithium Inventory

Lithium Inventory is intended to be a knowledge hub for battery science and electrochemistry. It is currently in the configuration phase.

Website template is based on the Relearn theme for Hugo (https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/index.html). Content is licensed according to the CC BY-NC-ND license.

## For contributors

You will need to install Hugo (>=0.110, https://gohugo.io) to build Lithium Inventory locally. In principle, you should be able to clone the repository, run `hugo serve` in the terminal and view the site at `localhost:1313` (default settings).

The `main` branch of this repository is deployed to lithiuminventory.com by Netlify.

The `rc-1` is the development (release candidate) version of the site which is viewable at https://effortless-stardust-a56e63.netlify.app - the intention is that all prospective content additions will be merged to this branch for review by relevant contributors before merging to the `main` branch.
